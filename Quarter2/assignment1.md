## Understanding OpenAI Chat Completion API Parameters

This repository is designed to explain the key parameters used with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. These parameters control the behavior and functionality of the API, ensuring it meets specific requirements for various applications. Below, you will find detailed explanations of the terms and parameters.

### Parameters Overview

1. **Messages**
   - The `messages` parameter provides the context for the conversation.
   - It consists of a list of dictionaries with `role` (e.g., `user`, `assistant`, `system`) and `content`.
   - Example:
     ```json
     [
       {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
       {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
     ]
     ```

2. **Model**
   - Specifies the model to be used (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
   - Choose based on task complexity, speed, and cost requirements.

3. **Max Completion Tokens**
   - Defines the maximum number of tokens the model can generate.
   - Helps manage response length and token limits.
   - Example: Setting `max_tokens` to `50` restricts the response length to 50 tokens.

4. **n**
   - Determines the number of response completions to generate.
   - Example: Setting `n: 3` generates three alternative responses.

5. **Stream**
   - Enables token-by-token streaming of the response when set to `true`.
   - Useful for real-time applications like chat interfaces.

6. **Temperature**
   - Controls the randomness of responses:
     - Higher values (e.g., `1.0`) generate more creative outputs.
     - Lower values (e.g., `0.2`) make responses more focused and deterministic.

7. **Top_p**
   - Adjusts the diversity of the response using nucleus sampling.
   - Includes tokens based on cumulative probability.
     - Example: `top_p: 0.1` limits responses to the top 10% of tokens.

8. **Tools**
   - Defines external tools or capabilities the model can use (e.g., APIs, calculators).
   - Extends the model's functionality to perform specific tasks.

### Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
